        <h1 class='main-title'>The deficit of sleep</h1>
        <h3 class='sub-title'>Public Health Problem</h3>
        <p class='main-text' id='0'>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has declared insufficient 
            sleep a “public health problem.” Indeed, according to a recent CDC study, more than a third of American adults are not 
            getting enough sleep on a regular basis (Liu et al., 2014). However, insufficient sleep is not exclusively a U.S. problem, 
            and also concerns other industrialised countries such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, or Canada (National Sleep Foundation, 2013). 
            According to recent evidence, the proportion of people getting less than the recommended hours of sleep is rising and is associated with lifestyle 
            factors related to a modern 24/7 society, such as psychosocial stress, unbalanced diet, lack of physical activity and excessive electronic media use, 
            among others (Roenneberg, 2013). This is alarming as insufficient sleep has been found to be associated 
            with a range of negative health and social outcomes, including adverse performance effects at school and in the labour market.</p>
            <h3 class='sub-title'>Effect on Adults and Children</h3>
            <p class='main-text' id='1'>
                While insufficient sleep can have detrimental impacts on all age cohorts, sleep deprivation among children and adolescents 
                may trigger irreversible long-term consequences. For instance, there is strong evidence for the association of quality and 
                quantity of sleep with school performance and cognitive ability among school-aged children and adolescents 
                (Blunden et al., 2000; Owens et al., 2000; Roberts et al., 2001). However, according to a National Sleep Foundation (2006) survey, 
                more than 87 percent of high school students in the United States get far less than the recommended hours of sleep, 
                and the amount of sleep they get is decreasing, posing a serious threat to their health and academic success.

            <h3 class='sub-title'>The Consequences of Sleep Deprivation</h3>
            <p class='main-text' id='2'>
                Given the potential adverse effects of insufficient sleep on health, well-being and productivity, the consequences of sleep-deprivation have 
                far-reaching societal and economic consequences. With the evidence on the economic consequences of sleep loss and disorders being limited so far, 
                there is an acute need for systematic analyses of the economic impacts of insufficient sleep, particularly given some evidence of rising rates of 
                insufficient sleep worldwide. This research study aims to raise awareness of the scale of insufficient sleep as a societal issue, quantifying the 
                economic costs of
                insufficient sleep as well as making recommendations and providing potential solutions that can help tackle this growing problem.

            <h3 class='sub-title'>The Effect on Productivity</h3>
            <p class='main-text' id='3'>
                For instance, on an annual basis, the U.S. loses an equivalent of about 1.23 million working days due to insufficient sleep. 
                This corresponds to about 9.9 million working hours. This is followed by Japan, which loses on average 0.6 million working days, 
                or 4.8 million working hours, per year. With 0.2 million days the UK and Germany have a similar amount of working time lost, corresponding
                 each to more than 1.65 million working hours. Among the five OECD countries examined, with about 0.08 million working days,
                 Canada has the least working time lost due to insufficient sleep, corresponding to about 0.6 million working hours.

            <h3 class='sub-title'>The Cost to the Economy</h3>
            <p class='main-text' id='4'>
                Our economic predictions indicate that in absolute terms, the U.S. sustains by far the highest annual economic loss 
                (between $280 billion and $411 billion currently, depending on the scenario) due to the size of its economy, followed by Japan 
                (between $88 billion and $138 billion). However, relative to the size of the overall economy, the estimated loss for Japan is actually larger 
                than for the U.S. (between 1.56 to 2.28 per cent for the U.S. and 1.86 per cent to 2.92 per cent for Japan, respectively). 
                This is followed by the UK (1.36 per cent to 1.86 per cent), Germany (1.02 per cent to 1.56 per cent) and Canada (0.85 per cent to 1.56 per cent).

            <h3 class='sub-title'>The Grim Outlook for the Future</h3>
            <p class='main-text' id='5'>
                The overall costs increase slightly in magnitude over time in all subsequent years of a given scenario, as the mortality effect of insufficient 
                sleep leads to reductions in the labour supply. That is, the death of a worker does not only affect the year the death occurs, but continues to be a 
                part of the costs in subsequent years because of the loss of all potential future offspring. To illustrate this point, the costs of insufficient sleep in 
                2020 for the U.S.range from $299 billion to $433 billion. However, this increases by 2030, where the range is from $318 to $456 billion.
