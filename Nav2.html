        <h1 class='about-title'>Housing Bubble and Renters</h1>
        <p class='about-text'>
            Landlords throughout the country are drastically increasing the prices at an unprecedented rate leaving renters without a way to keep up.
            Over the course of this last year, rent has increased as high as 17% percent in many large cities all over the country. Not only are people
            struggling to get back on track after the previous year many of them lost their job or were forced out of one, now they have a new challenge,
            finding a way to keep up with the ever-increasing rent prices.Eviction bans also are playing a role in keeping the market tight, because about
             6% of tenants are normally forced to vacate each year. 
            Zandi estimates the country’s shortage of affordable rentals is the worst since at least the post-World War II period.Developers are adding new supply. 
            But in the short run, the squeeze will have economic consequences because workers can’t easily move for jobs 
            and will have less to spend on things other than housing. Soaring rental costs also are a contributor to the Federal Reserve’s inflation expectations.

        <h3 class='sub-title'>The Areas Effected the Most</h3>
        <p class='about-text'>
            The soaring demand is most pronounced in Sun Belt cities that have seen an influx of arrivals from the pandemic. The Phoenix area had the country’s 
            biggest increases in rents for single-family houses in June, with an almost 17% surge from a year earlier, 
            according to data released this week from Corelogic. It was followed by Las Vegas, with a 12.9% gain; Tucson, Arizona, at 12.5%; and Miami, up 12.4%.
            It’s a reversal from the pre-pandemic norm of tight housing in denser, pricier cities -- places such as New York, Boston and San Francisco, which saw
            office workers flee during lockdowns. Those areas still have an overhang of inventory of high-end apartments aimed at white-collar professionals. Still,
            demand is picking up.

        <h3 class='sub-title'>The Grim Outlook for the Future</h3>
        <p class='about-text'>
            Developers are adding new supply. But in the short run, the squeeze will have economic consequences because workers can’t easily move for jobs and will 
            have less to spend 
            on things other than housing. Soaring rental costs also are a contributor to the Federal Reserve’s inflation expectations.
            They may not yet be accurately reflected in some measures. Owners’ equivalent rent of residences, which makes up almost a quarter of the consumer price index, 
            rose 2.4% in July from a year earlier. That figure “lags the reality” because it’s based on a survey of homeowner expectations about what their 
            home would rent for, Zandi said.
